<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

* Food Delivery is a one-page healthy food ordering website. On this site, a user can get acquainted with the menu and learn more about each of the food styles. 
* One feature of this site is that it allows them to calculate the number of calories in a meal. There is also an abilityÂ to contact users to clarify the order. 
* Menu data and user requests are stored on a local JSON server. In case of any changes by a user, the server reloads itself and the changes are automatically saved to a local JSON file. 
* Its main goal is to learn how to work with vanilla JavaScript and the module builder.
